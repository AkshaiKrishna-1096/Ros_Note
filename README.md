## ROS communication basics
---

### ‚ùì What are DDS and Peer-to-Peer Communication?

**Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication** means that each node acts as a **peer** capable of directly communicating with other nodes **without relying on a central server**. Each node can function as both a **client** and a **server**, enabling decentralized and distributed communication.

**DDS (Data Distribution Service)** is a **publish-subscribe communication middleware** that automatically discovers and connects nodes without a centralized server. It forms a **scalable**, **low-latency**, and **decentralized system**, solving the single point of failure problem.

DDS handles **communication logic** under the hood using **peer-to-peer logic**.

### ‚ùì Why Did ROS 2 Drop the ROS Master?

In **ROS 1**, the **ROS Master** served as a central agent to manage communication between nodes. However, this led to a **single point of failure**‚Äîif the master crashed, the entire system could become non-functional.

**ROS 2** eliminated the master by adopting **DDS**, which enables **decentralized communication** through automatic node discovery and **peer-to-peer messaging**.

This change improves:
- ‚úÖ **Scalability**
- ‚úÖ **Fault tolerance**
- ‚úÖ **Real-time performance**
- ‚úÖ Ability to configure **Quality of Service (QoS)**


DDS provides **QoS (Quality of Service)** controls, allowing ROS 2 developers to:

- Choose between **reliable** and **best-effort** delivery
- Set **latency budgets** and **lifespan** of messages
- Control **history** and **durability** for late-joining nodes

These features are essential for making **highly capable Robot**.
